"""https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/fizzbuzz/
 Fizzbuzz is one of the most basic problems in the coding interview world. Try to write a small and elegant code for this problem. 
Given a positive integer A, return an array of strings with all the integers from 1 to N. 
But for multiples of 3 the array should have “Fizz” instead of the number. 
For the multiples of 5, the array should have “Buzz” instead of the number. 
For numbers which are multiple of 3 and 5 both, the array should have “FizzBuzz” instead of the number.

Look at the example for more details.

Example

A = 5
Return: [1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz]
"""
class Solution:
    # @param A : integer
    # @return a list of strings
    def fizzBuzz(self, A):
        target_list = []
        for i in range(1, A+1, 1):
            if i%3 == 0 and i%5 == 0:
                target_list.append("FizzBuzz")
            elif i%3 == 0:
                target_list.append("Fizz")
            elif i%5 == 0:
                target_list.append("Buzz")
            else:
                target_list.append(i)
        return target_list
